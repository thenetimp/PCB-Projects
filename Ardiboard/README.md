Ardiboard
=================================

Arduino is meant to be a prototyping platform, but it seems many people are willing to just go out and drop $30/project on new Arduino's when you can make due with $10 worth of components.  Ardiboard is the solution for those of us who want to make projects using the Arduino Uno platform without having to spend $30 on an Arduino Uno everytime we create a project.

Ardiboard is designed to be Arduino Shield compatible. It does not contain and FTDI chip or a USB chip.  It has 5 pins that can be used to connect to an external FTDI breakout board that you can reuse on all your projects for uploading sketches.  And is designed so power is supplied from the Vin pin on the shield it is connected too and regulated by a 5V regulator on the Ardiboard. Though I am on the fence about adding a means of adding power directly to the board.
